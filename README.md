### Translation Workflow
1. Extension configuration required in `Site Configuration`:
   1. Easy Language is set up manually
   2. All fields defined in `Configuration\SiteConfiguration\Overrides\sites.php` are filled out in backend.

2. `DataHandler.php` hook is responsible for triggering translation upon action `new` and `update` on a tt_content with `sys_lanuage_id` of standard German setup in previous step.
   1. Utility class `SummAiTranslator.php` class is responsible for either creating new translation via POST request to Summ Ai API or updating existing one (depends on action on tt_content).
   2. Created / updated translation has a `sys_language_id` of Easy German defined in step 1.
   3. Utility class `RecordHelper.php` is responsible for database queries (creating and updating translation records for tt_content).
   4. Utility class `RequestHelper.php` is responsible for API request processing.
   5. Utility class `TranslationHelper.php` provides various support functions for `SummAiTranslator.php` class and widgets.

3. As of now translation is done automatically on tt_content level, meaning that for translation of already existing entries it needs to be enabled and disabled to trigger the hook.
